# SuperAdventure
C# game using Scott Lilly's guide from ScottLilly.com

Nothing special. Will expand on it a bit to get the basics of C# and a good action adventure structure.
A neat tutorial overall that adresses some basic parts of building a project like this I had not seen 
laid out so neatly. 

Currently in the format of a Visual Studio project folder.
